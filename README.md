# LMGTech.DotNetPostal

.NET bindings for [libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal)

## Overview

This project wraps the libpostal C library and provides a more natural .NET experience over the generic p/Invoke DllImport mechanism. It relies on [SWIG](https://www.swig.org) to do the heavy lifting for auto-generating p/Invoke calls to platform-specific libraries.

Things to note:

* 64-bit OS only
* Supports Windows/MacOS/Linux
  * For Windows it requires Universal C Runtime - this is present for Windows 10+ but needs to be installed manually for editions of Windows prior to 10
* Currently does not support ARM
* To use this library you need the libpostal trained data - that can't be included in the repo due to github repo file size limitations

## Downloading libpostal Trained Model Data

For Windows, you need to ensure you have a bash shell available - Git for Windows includes one, WSL2 also has this ability etc.

1. Open a terminal that supports bash in the root directory where you have cloned this repository
2. Run `./install_libpostal_data.sh`, which will
   1. Download the [trained model data](https://github.com/loanmarket/dotnet-postal/releases/download/dotnet-postal-data-v1.0.0/libpostaldata.zip)
   2. Unzip the file
   3. Copy the data to the two test projects, which include it as content in their csproj files
   4. Remove the downloaded zip file and extracted folder

## Building

Compiled native libraries for libpostal for Windows/MacOS/Linux with SWIG wrapper entry points are included in this repo. To build simply open the solution and build.

During build a nuget package is created and placed in `/package-feed`

LMGTech.DotNetPostal.Tests use a project reference to LMGTech.DotNetPostal - some trickery is required to allow the tests to load the native libraries on each supported runtime.

## Building Native Libraries

_Note: This is only needed when libpostal is updated - normally not required to just build this repository if you're only adding features to DotNetPostal._

Follow the platform-specific native build instructions below.

In the following steps it's assumed that:

1. You cloned the libpostal git repo into a folder located at `{libpostal-path}`
2. This repo is cloned into a folder located at `{dotnet-postal-path}`

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

#### Linux - Prerequisites

1. Install the following packages
   1. `sudo apt-get install curl autoconf automake libtool pkg-config git`
   2. `sudo apt-get install swig`

#### Linux - Building libpostal

1. Open your preferred terminal at `{dotnet-postal-path}/swig`
2. Run `./generate_swig_files.sh {libpostal-path}` - e.g. `./generate_swig_files.sh ~/github/libpostal`
   1. Creates a `{libpostal-path}/src/libpostal_wrap.c` wrapper C file
   2. Generates C# p/Invoke code at `{dotnet-postal-path}/src/LMGTech.DotNetPostal/Generated`
   3. Includes `libpostal_wrap.c` in `{libpostal-path}/src/Makefile.am` to ensure it is built when building libpostal
3. Follow the [Linux build instructions for libpostal](https://github.com/openvenues/libpostal#installation-maclinux)
    1. Note: You don't need to do the final step `make install` i.e. you don't need to install the library on the machine as we only need the shared library file
    2. You need to make a note of the configured `--datadir` that you specified during the build of libpostal - this directory is configured as part of the libpostal build process and is auto-populated with ML model data during the libpostal build process
4. Open your preferred terminal at `{dotnet-postal-path}/swig`
5. Run `./copy_libpostal_library.sh {libpostal-path}` - e.g. `./copy_libpostal_library.sh ~/github/libpostal`
   1. Copies the relevant platform-specific shared library to the platform-specific area under `{dotnet-postal-path}/src/LMGTech.DotNetPostal/runtimes`
6. Copy the contents of the configured libpostal `--datadir` to the following places:
   1. `/tests/LMGTech.DotNetPostal.Tests/libpostaldata/`
   2. `/tests/LMGTech.DotNetPostal.NuGet.Tests/libpostaldata/`

### MacOS
